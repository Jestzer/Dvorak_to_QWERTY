# Dvorak to QWERTY (WIP)
Many programmers forget that anything other than US-QWERTY exists, leading to programs that don't function properly when using any other layout.
While this program doesn't fix all the issues related to it, it will take your normally-written out sentence and convert it to "type it out correctly" for
programs that don't recognize nor consider that you're using a Dvorak keyboard. Enjoy.
